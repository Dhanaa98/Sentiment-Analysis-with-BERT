"Been a regular at this McDonald's ever since 2003 since it was a couple of blocks away from my high school. It is considered the McDonald's of the Financial District or Wall Street McDonald's for me. They remodeled and renovated this McDonald's so now they lost the old touch which I missed. This McDonald's used to have a piano, a fancy staircase to go up to the 2nd floor for dine in. There was also a showcase of McDonald's memorabilia but I don't see that anymore. Now it is more modern and have a pick up section along with many kiosks to do self ordering which is the norm these days for anyone who don't want to talk to people.This time when I got to McDonald's I ordered a double Big Mac which consists of 4 patties! Like always, the Big Mac wins my heart and never fail to satisfy me. I would forever love Big Mac and I don't think anyone or anything can stop me from loving it! It's my favorite item on the menu. The sauce that is in the sandwich is what makes it so delicious!  French fries are the best! I can forever eat them but of course I got to watch my weight and health! Fries are never a disappointment and the way they make it tastes so addicting! So McDonald's my number 1 when it comes to burgers snd fries!!!",5
Quick pick up and delivery location.. kind of slow in processing orders but the engagement is there. Place looks clean and the food tastes pretty good .. it's hard to catch the ambiance with the crowd but overall it's a convenient location.,4
I hate this pLACE THERE was a rat in my caramel frappe i saw a cow in the back that they were milking they said the ice cream there was broken there was an employee right behind me i asked for a fish fillet i got a cheese burger i tried to take it back they hopped over the counter and beet i ordered a sprite it tasted like acid,1
I loved this place! I got a coke slushy and the staff were super nice. The prices were very low so me and my friends got a lot of food. Overall I would recommend going to this McDonald's.,5
"The food comes out in a very timely manner, with the utmost precision regardless of how late into the night I order from them. The staff are also very polite despite the constant and high traffic in the business.",4
"This McDonald is good lactation.  It is near Trinity Church and Wall Street and World Trade Center and New York City hall, etc.  So, after tourists walked around these areas, they can take a rest at this McDonald.   In terms of convenient location, I recommend it.  if you come from direction of Wall Street and Trinity Church, you go straight along with Broadway Street.  This McDonald is facing the street, If you walk along with the street from the area of both city hall and Wall Street, you will come across it.  So this McDonald is good lactation.   The service and menu are the same others McDonalds.",4
"Worst place I've ever been to.  I've been here for over an hour and a half waiting for my food and is not even ready.   To make matters even worst, I worked in Mc Donald's when I was in undergrad: I never had a patron wait over an hour for food.",1
Nobody speaks proper English they all speak Spanish I tried there several times because of the closest of my job site and we order coffee there  every time we try to order it get messed up down to the fact  they added stuff that my coworker was allergic to  thank god i reviewed it again  this place need a  make over not only that they refuse customer to employees transaction saying we have to use the keyios machines !!!! If you want high blood pressure and stress come to this Location,1
"Perfect meal, perfect food for my family.This service is yet, the best McDonald.We are enjoying it and having the best day after :)",5
found a roach in my big mac the chicken nuggets gave me food poisoning. i had to wait an hour for my horrible trash food. The worker spat in my food I saw them do it with my own to eyes. The only thing good about my meal was the cold dry fries. You should be lucky im giving 1 star.,1
